# IPL Frontend (React)

This is the modern React frontend for the Cricket Predictor Advanced project. It connects to the Flask backend API and provides a rich user interface for cricket match predictions, leaderboards, profiles, and more.

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- Backend API running (see main project README for backend setup)

## 🚀 Getting Started

In this directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs all dependencies.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

## 🔗 Backend API Integration

This frontend expects the backend Flask API to be running (by default at http://localhost:5000). You may need to update API endpoint URLs in the source code if your backend runs elsewhere.

## 📝 Features

- User authentication and persistent login
- Match prediction and stats
- Leaderboard and profile pages
- Integration with backend ML model

## 📁 Project Structure

- `src/` — React source code
